### Patch Changes

- b2566cc: Republish with internal dependencies resolved to real semver instead of the literal `workspace:*`
  protocol string. Every previously published version of this package shipped with that bug (found by
  `scripts/release/audit-workspace-protocol.ts`), because the release pipeline packed with `npm
pack`/`npm publish`, which doesn't understand pnpm's `workspace:` protocol; it now packs with
  `pnpm pack` first, which resolves it. No functional change beyond the dependency ranges themselves.
- Updated dependencies [b2566cc]
