# CHANGELOG

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- b2566cc: Republish with internal dependencies resolved to real semver instead of the literal `workspace:*`
  protocol string. Every previously published version of this package shipped with that bug (found by
  `scripts/release/audit-workspace-protocol.ts`), because the release pipeline packed with `npm
pack`/`npm publish`, which doesn't understand pnpm's `workspace:` protocol; it now packs with
  `pnpm pack` first, which resolves it. No functional change beyond the dependency ranges themselves.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 8391068: Add `sanitizeSvg` to `@pantoken/utils`: a zero-dependency regex-based helper
  that strips `<script>` elements and `on*` event-handler attributes from SVG
  markup. Applied at decode time in `@pantoken/icons` so every icon in the
  `icons` array and `iconsByName` map has script injection removed before
  exposure to consumers. Defense-in-depth for the vendored IR; does not change
  clean SVG content.
- Updated dependencies [8391068]
  - @pantoken/model@0.3.0

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 0306bf4: Add explicit type annotations required by `isolatedDeclarations`; no API changes.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 2e5bb88: Update workspace configuration to integrate fast-check property-based testing framework.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [e099a51]
  - @pantoken/model@0.2.0

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 3d2f6db: # Enrich npm package metadata

  Every published package now carries `homepage`, `bugs`, `repository.directory`, `sideEffects`,
  `engines`, and `publishConfig.provenance`. npmjs.com pages link back to the docs site, the issue
  tracker, and the exact monorepo folder; `sideEffects` lets bundlers tree-shake the pure packages
  while preserving the stylesheets in the CSS-shipping ones.

- Updated dependencies [3d2f6db]
  - @pantoken/model@0.1.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c8b956d: # CDN distribution: lean token sheet, component-icons, and web-component drop-ins

  Publish the files the CDN combine URLs (and the docs picker) point at:

  - **`@pantoken/css`** — new `style.lean.css` export: the full sheet minus the
    `--instui-icon-*` glyph set (~22.5 KB gzip vs ~140 KB), the recommended CDN
    foundation. Both sheets now carry the elevation + focus-outline custom
    properties. Adds a runtime dependency on `@pantoken/utils`.
  - **`@pantoken/components`** — new `component-icons.css` export (the ~11 icons the
    component sheets reference), so a per-component CDN load resolves its icons
    against the lean sheet. The elevation + focus-outline custom properties are no
    longer defined in `components.css`/`base.css` — they now ship in the token
    sheet, so load a token sheet alongside the component CSS (already required for
    all other tokens). Adds a runtime dependency on `@pantoken/utils`.
  - **`@pantoken/web-components`** — `register(target, { only })` registers a subset
    of elements (nested dependencies pulled in automatically); new
    `dist/web-components.iife.js` `<script>` drop-in. The `foundationCss` export and
    its auto-injected `<style>` are removed — the required token sheet now carries
    those custom properties.
  - **`@pantoken/utils`** — now owns the elevation + focus-outline declaration
    builders (`elevationDeclarations`, `focusOutlineDeclarations`, `focusOutlineRules`,
    `ELEVATION_NAMES`, `FOCUSABLE_SELECTOR`) so the token sheet can emit them.

## 0.1.0

### Added

- Initial release of @pantoken/utils.
